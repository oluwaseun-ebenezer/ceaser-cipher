Instructions on how to use this cipher program are listed below:
1.  create an object - instance of the Cipher class
2.  To encrypt, call the object function .encrypt() and pass two arguments: text to be encrypted, and the key
3.  To decrypt, call the object function .decrypt() and pass two arguments: text to be encrypted, and the key

To run this, do one of the two below:

1.  Copy and run the below 4 lines of code

from cipher import Cipher

cipher = Cipher()
cipher.encrypt()
cipher.decrypt()

2.  Run the sample.py
